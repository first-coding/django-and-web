# django-and-web
This is a django and Web front - and back -end separation project.ã€‚

# Introduce
The topic of this project  is  professional analysis,which  can  help  them get employed.
However,this project is not perfect yet,and I  will continue to  improve  it.

by the way,The repository is full of front-end code,and The Django deployment side is still being optimized,
if you need project and run,you need to have Django and the front-end on the same LAN

There are some bugs in this project,please bear with me

# file path
Third director is django file
first/first/web director is web file

# run
The web file need environment in the vscode,you can use Extensions "Live Server" to start web project.by the way,you should change .html run path.

To start a Django file,simple run the "python manage.py runserver" command.but you should install django package and stay same path with manage.py.

# other 
Other html file are crawler generated file that you don't need to worry about,you just have to focus on the files in the third and first folders
